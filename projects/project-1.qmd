## Overview

Email automation platform for small service-based business owners drowning in their inboxes.

**Status:** Deep in validation with extensive user research

**Timeline:** September 2024 - Present

**Role:** Founder/Product Developer

## The Problem

Small business owners spend 15-20 hours per week managing email—time they could spend growing their business. They miss important messages, stay up late staying caught up, and have no visibility into client communication history.

One business owner told me: *"I became an entrepreneur to help people, not to live in my inbox. But that's where I spend most of my time now."*

## The Solution

Intelligent email management that saves business owners 10+ hours per week.

**Planned features:**

- Smart prioritization that surfaces what needs attention
- Workflow automation for routine emails
- Context-aware template suggestions
- Complete communication history per client
- Analytics on where time is actually going

## Current Status

- 20+ user interviews completed
- Testing core concepts with real users
- Building detailed user personas and journey maps

**Why validation first?** Too many products are built on assumptions. I'm making sure I understand the real problem before building the solution.

## How I'm Approaching This

**Talk to users constantly.** Weekly interviews and shadowing sessions to understand how they actually work.

**Validate before building.** Testing concepts with prototypes and getting feedback on what would actually save time.

**Focus on real impact.** Not building every feature—focusing on what genuinely saves 10+ hours per week.

## Key Insights

**Business owners don't want another email app.** They want time back to do the work they actually love.

**Different businesses need different workflows.** The solution needs flexibility to adapt.

**Integration is critical.** Adding another standalone tool won't work—it needs to integrate with existing systems.

**Trust matters.** Automation that feels risky won't get adopted.

## What's Next

**Short-term:** Complete 30+ user interviews, finalize product requirements, build high-fidelity prototypes, determine technical stack

**Long-term:** Develop MVP focused on highest-impact features, launch beta with small group, iterate based on usage data, scale to thousands of business owners
