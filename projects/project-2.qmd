**Role:** Founder/Product Developer

## The Problem

Companies receive thousands of customer messages but reading, categorizing, and responding takes hours every week. Customer service teams spend 15-20 hours/week sorting messages, miss valuable insights in the volume, and struggle to maintain personalized responses at scale.

## The Solution

An AI platform that automates categorization and analysis while keeping humans in control.

**What it does:**

- Auto-categorizes messages by topic, sentiment, and urgency
- Extracts key insights and trends
- Generates response suggestions that match company voice
- Provides analytics to track sentiment over time

## Current Status

- Working prototype deployed to multiple companies
- Teams reporting 60-70% time savings on categorization
- Companies actively requesting additional features

**Building now:** Multi-tenant architecture, custom AI training per company, advanced analytics, CRM integrations

## How I Built It

**User research first.** Interviewed customer service managers to understand real pain points.

**Ship fast.** Got working prototype into users' hands quickly rather than perfecting in private.

**Iterate based on feedback.** Real usage data shaped the roadmap.

**Technical approach:** NLP and sentiment analysis, cloud infrastructure, multi-tenant backend, dashboard UI

## Key Insights

**Companies want augmentation, not automation.** Best version gives teams smart suggestions they review and approve—they stay in control.

**Security is critical.** Separate, secure backends for each company aren't optional when handling customer data.

**Early traction validates the problem.** Companies using it and reporting results confirmed we're solving real pain.

## What's Next

**Short-term:** Complete secure backend, implement custom AI training, add advanced analytics

**Long-term:** Scale to more companies and industries, build CRM integrations, expand to other communication types
