## The Problem

Companies receive thousands of pieces of physical mail—fan letters, customer correspondence, packages—but processing them takes hours every week. Teams spend 15-20 hours/week manually reading addresses, categorizing mail by sender and type, and organizing responses. Important mail gets lost in the pile, and there's no easy way to track correspondence history or manage responses at scale.

## The Solution

An AI-powered platform that automates physical mail processing while keeping humans in control.

**What it does:**

- **Intelligent Mail Scanning:** Uses Google Gemini Vision API to extract sender information from photos of physical mail (envelopes, postcards, packages)—even handwritten addresses
- **Return Address Extraction:** Automatically identifies and extracts return addresses from mail photos
- **Sender Identification:** Captures sender names for easy organization
- **Mail Type Classification:** Categorizes mail by type for efficient sorting
- **Address Verification:** Validates and standardizes addresses with Smarty's USPS database
- **Sorting & Organization:** Allows users to sort and manage incoming mail efficiently
- **Response Management:** Enables printing out responses to fan mail and customer correspondence

## Current Status

- Working prototype being tested by several companies
- Early testers are loving the results—reporting significant time savings on mail processing
- Collecting real-world feedback to shape next features

**Building now:** Multi-tenant architecture, batch processing capabilities, advanced filtering and search, CRM integrations

## How I Built It

**User research first.** Interviewed companies that process high volumes of physical mail to understand real pain points.

**Ship fast.** Got working prototype into users' hands quickly rather than perfecting in private.

**Iterate based on feedback.** Real usage data from companies processing actual fan mail shaped the roadmap.

**Technical stack:** Python/Flask backend, Google Gemini Vision API for intelligent OCR (reads even handwritten addresses), Smarty address verification for USPS validation, Supabase authentication and database, deployed on Render with cloud infrastructure

## Key Insights

**Companies want augmentation, not automation.** The best version extracts and organizes mail data automatically, but keeps humans in control of responses and decisions.

**Accuracy matters more than speed.** Users need confidence in the extracted addresses and sender information—that's where AI vision models shine over traditional OCR.

**Security is critical.** Separate, secure backends for each company aren't optional when handling customer correspondence and address data.

**Early traction validates the problem.** Companies testing it and loving the results confirmed we're solving real pain.

## What's Next

**Short-term:** Complete multi-tenant architecture, implement batch processing for high-volume mail, add advanced filtering and search

**Long-term:** Scale to more companies and industries, build integrations with CRM and response management systems, expand to additional mail types and use cases
