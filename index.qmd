## About Me

BYU Strategic Management student specializing in corporate strategy and product development. I thrive on turning complex business challenges into actionable solutions. When I'm not in class studying AI prototyping or data analytics, you'll find me deep in user research for my latest ventureâ€”an email platform designed to give small business owners their time back.
