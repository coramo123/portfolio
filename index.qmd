<div class="intro-content">

I first learned to solve problems at Latin America's top boutique hotels—[VIK](https://www.vikretreats.com/) and [Awasi](https://awasi.com/)—where understanding what people need is everything. I got really good at anticipating needs and solving problems in real-time for high-profile guests.

Then I came to BYU to scale that impact. Now I study strategy in the Honors Program and serve as VP of Strategy & WSA, focusing on strategic growth and operations. My experience spans marketing, analytics, and product development—giving me perspective on both the impact of problems and the structure needed to solve them.

**I'm seeking internships in product management or corporate strategy where I can work on collaborative teams to solve meaningful problems.**
