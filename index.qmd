## About Me

I'm a Strategic Management student at BYU, specializing in corporate strategy and product development. I thrive on transforming complex business challenges into actionable, data-driven solutions.

Currently, I'm channeling my passion for problem-solving into developing an email management platform for small business owners. Through extensive user research and market validation, I'm working to create a solution that gives entrepreneurs their most valuable resource back: time.
