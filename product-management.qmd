<div class="intro-content">

I build products that solve real problems. My approach combines user research, strategic thinking, and hands-on development to create solutions that people actually want to use.

From validating ideas through extensive user interviews to shipping working prototypes that companies are actively testing, I focus on understanding what people need and building systems that deliver real value.
