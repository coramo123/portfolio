## My Approach

At my core, I’m curious about how things work and how they can work better, then finding what’s broken, improving it, and building systems that last. Whether it’s optimizing workflows, developing products, or solving strategic challenges, I’m drawn to problems where I can make a tangible impact.

## Where It Started

Growing up all around the world in places like Antigua, Guatemala, coastal Uruguay, the Sacred Valley of Peru, etc., taught me to adapt quickly and see problems from different perspectives. I learned early that understanding people and context is just as important as technical skills.

That adaptability became essential when I started working at [VIK](https://www.vikretreats.com/) and [Awasi](https://awasi.com/), two of Latin America's best boutique hotels. These aren't ordinary properties. They're world-class retreats where CEOs, actresses, and high-profile guests come to disconnect.

My job was to make sure their experience was flawless. I learned to anticipate needs before they were voiced, solve problems in real-time, and understand what people actually wanted versus what they said they wanted. It was like being a detective and problem-solver rolled into one.

I loved it. But I could only help one guest at a time.

## The Pivot to Strategy

I wanted to help more people, and I saw technology, particularly AI, as a way to scale that impact. So I came to BYU to learn how to combine my problem-solving instincts with business strategy, data analysis, and product development.

At BYU's Strategic Management Program (Honors), I'm focusing on corporate strategy and product management. I currently serve as VP of Strategy & WSA, where I work on strategic growth and operations. My experience has expanded to include marketing, analytics, and product development, giving me a broader toolkit to identify problems and architect solutions.

The hospitality background still shapes how I work. I start with the user. I ask questions. I watch how people actually behave, not just what they say they need. Then I build solutions that feel intuitive, not because they're simple, but because they solve the real problem.

## What I'm Working On Now

**Product Management:**
- [Fan Mail Analysis Platform](projects/project-2.qmd)
- [Email Management Platform](projects/project-1.qmd)

**Marketing:**
- [Landed Travel](marketing/landed-travel.qmd)
- [Women in Strategy Association](marketing/wsa.qmd)

## What I'm Looking For

Internships in product management or corporate strategy where I can work on meaningful problems, collaborate with great teams, learn from strong mentors, and ship real solutions.
